\title{\ConTeXt{} Lecture template}

Hello, there! Welcome to the world of \ConTeXt{}! I am working on a document template with some convenient and non-trivial features built in. I'm going for the look of old \emph{Invent. Math.} papers.

\starttheorem
This is an example of a very short theorem.

\starttheorem
This is an example of a long theorem. \ipsum[alternative=lines, n=4, right={  }]

\startproof
This is an example of a long proof. \ipsum[alternative=lines, n=8, right={  }]

This has some fun features such as some convenient \IPA{} functions, making it relatively easy to do \IPAsegment{s\IPAlookup[vowel][nearclose, unrounded, front]l'i \IPAlookup[consonant][nonsibilant, voiced, fricative,dental]i\IPAlookup[consonant][velar, nasal, voiced]z la\IPAlookup[combining][tiemark]\IPAlookup[vowel][nearclose, unrounded,front]k \IPAlookup[consonant][nonsibilant, voiced,fricative,dental]\IPAlookup[vowel][nearclose, unrounded, front]s}
